            <p>My name is Mustapha Ojuenimala, and I am from Nigeria, a country celebrated for its vibrance, diversity,
                and rich
                cultural heritage. Nigeria is home to over 250 ethnic groups, each with unique traditions, languages,
                and values that
                make the nation truly dynamic. Growing up in such an environment has shaped my curiosity and
                appreciation for knowledge
                and innovation. I enjoy coding because it challenges me to think creatively and solve problems, while
                also opening
                opportunities to build useful solutions for the future. Beyond programming, I find joy in exploring new
                ideas and
                engaging in continuous learning, as I believe growth comes from seeking knowledge daily. As a student in
                the BYU-Pathway
                program, I am eager to strengthen my academic foundation, develop professional skills, and connect with
                peers who share
                a commitment to progress. I see this journey as a stepping stone toward achieving my long-term goals.

            <h2>Nigeria</h2>
            <img src="images/nigeria.jpeg" alt="Nigeria my country">
            <p>Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the most populous country on the continent with over 220 million
                people. It is often
                called the "Giant of Africa" due to its large population, cultural diversity, and economic influence.
                Nigeria is a
                federal republic made up of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Lagos, its largest city,
                is a major
                commercial hub. The country is ethnically diverse, with over 250 ethnic groups, including Hausa, Yoruba,
                and Igbo, each
                contributing to Nigeriaâ€™s rich cultural heritage. English is the official language, while numerous
                indigenous languages
                are spoken nationwide. Nigeriaâ€™s economy is the largest in Africa, driven by oil and gas, agriculture,
                and a growing
                tech sector. The nation is also known for its vibrant music, Nollywood film industry, and literary
                icons. Despite
                challenges such as political instability and poverty, Nigeria remains a regional leader and a symbol of
                resilience in
                Africa.</p>
